# Tests for MPC

The first test was accomplished and can be found under Person.py.

The second test was not accomplished for a couple of reasons, the main ones being not having a Maya license (with python scripting) to visualise the tool I was trying to make and lacking experience with the software in itself. I've realised too late that I could've work on something with Blender instead. I've looked into how to make the tool easily however, and this very similar project helped me to better understand to workings behind Maya and Python (http://chriswen3d.com/dev-portfolio/2020/7/14/python-turntable-maya-tool).
